Description of the PowerShell Script:

This PowerShell script is designed to clear the browser cache for **Google Chrome** and **Mozilla Firefox** on a Windows PC. It does the following:

1. **Clear Chrome Cache:**
   - It identifies the cache folder for Google Chrome located at:
     - `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache`
   - If the cache folder exists, the script will delete all files and subfolders inside the `Cache` directory.
   - If the cache folder does not exist, the script will inform you that the cache path was not found.

2. **Clear Firefox Cache:**
   - It looks for the cache directory for Mozilla Firefox, which is located within Firefox profiles at:
     - `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles`
   - The script loops through all user profiles and deletes the cache files from the `cache2` folder for each profile it finds.
   - If the cache directory for a profile does not exist, it will notify you that no cache was found for that profile.
   - If no Firefox profiles exist, it will inform you that the Firefox cache path was not found.

Key Points:
- The script targets **Chrome** and **Firefox** but can be adapted to other browsers or paths by modifying the folder paths.
- It does not clear browser history or cookies, only cached files (temporary internet files).
- **Administrator privileges** are recommended when running the script to avoid any permission issues when deleting files.
  
This is a quick way to free up space and potentially resolve issues caused by old cache files for these browsers.
